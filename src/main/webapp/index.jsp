In order to get AardWARk to sync your application, simply rename the war file to:

aardwark-&lt;path to project home&gt;, with slashes replaced by dots. For example:

<strong>aardwark-.home.workspace.hello-world</strong> would sync the project in /home/workspace/hello-world with the appropriate application within the web context

The target application is chosen by examining the artifact name
